Why did you use the tools, language ..
- Java is my primary programming language and good for OOPs. I used Java here as it provides various library functions for helping with CSV loading, JSON rendering, sorting etc.
- Maven is used for easy dependency management. In this project many dependencies are used as mentioned below
- com.opencsv.CSVReader was used to easily read CSV data. The single quote (‘) character delimits the contents of the input, and inside that single quote the “ character appears at index 0. Double quotes are a normal part of CSV syntax and that’s a good reason to use a library like OpenCSV when working with CSV files.
- for org.json.JSONObject for rendering Json output
- Lombok for adding annotations for easiy use of access modifiers, getters, setters and constructors.
- Guice?

assumptions:
- The net per Payer balance cannot be negative.
- Negative points are deducted from the other positive points starting from the oldest transaction first. This is kind of intuitive as it means that we try to first clear off the amounts outstanding for a longer period of time.
- The points fit in the Integer limit.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

Advantages:
- Takes care of cases with negative transaction amounts. Also takes of cases where net cummulative amount per Payer at any point in time can be negative. (but the final cummulative amount is assumed to always be positive, as mentioned in the task description)
- The code is written in a modular way using OOPs concepts, Classes, Interfaces, DTOs, Utils etc. allowing for easy future modifications. Using Singleton pattern wherever possible - for example getTransactionComparator() in AccountingUtils class.


Disadvantages:
